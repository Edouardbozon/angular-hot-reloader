### Roadmap

* 26/02 -> Project initialized with as much fix as possible
* 02/03 -> Blog post written + TodoMvC examples
* 04/03 -> Package published :metal:

### To fix
##### Blocker
- [x] Expose loader in one module

##### Nice to have
- [ ] Update doc with single loader (-> name convention)
- [ ] Clean old compiled `template` in `template loader`
- [ ] Write injected code in ES5
- [ ] Transpile loader in ES5
- [ ] Find a way to test the loader
- [ ] Check is we have to use `vm` in `controller loader` or if there is a more generic way.
- [ ] Clean deleted method in `prototype` (service and component loaders)
- [ ] Make it configurable
- [ ] Make it easy to setup
- [ ] Make mention in `README.md` "Use this only in `dev`"
- [ ] Create examples
- [ ] Create screencast
- [ ] Support controller-less template in `template loader`
